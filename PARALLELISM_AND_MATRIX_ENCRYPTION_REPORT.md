## 1. Parallelism Implementation Strategy

### 1.1 Parallel Computing Architecture

Our implementation employs a **hybrid threading model** that combines:

- **ThreadPoolExecutor** for fine-grained control over worker threads
- **Concurrent.futures** for asynchronous task management
- **NumPy vectorization** for mathematical operations optimization
- **Dynamic load balancing** for optimal resource utilization

```python
# Core parallel processing implementation
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:
    future_to_worker = {
        executor.submit(self._process_chunk_worker, chunk, self.key_matrix, i, start_time): i
        for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks[:num_workers])
    }
    
    for future in as_completed(future_to_worker):
        worker_result = future.result()
        results.append(worker_result['result'])
